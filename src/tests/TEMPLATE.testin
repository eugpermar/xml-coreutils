# Hi there, this is an example template. The compile_test.sh
# script takes this template, and puts boilerplate script around
# it to produce the actual test shell script which is executed
# when you "make check".
#
# The sections are mandatory and cannot be rearranged. 
# If input or output contains tabs they must be escaped
# The test command(s) should be verbatim on one line.
# The output will be diff'd with the command output.

_PURPOSE_
Some text explaining the test will be printed in case it fails
_INPUT_ 
Some lines representing an input file on stdin (verbatim).
Second line of input. This is a here-document, so go crazy :)
_COMMAND_
cat
_EXITCODE_
0
_OUTPUT_
Some lines representing the required output (verbatim).
_END_
