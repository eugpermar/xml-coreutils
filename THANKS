xml-coreutils THANKS file

The xml-coreutils software was originally conceived and written by
Laird Breyer. Over time, several people have contributed by
reporting problems, suggesting improvements and submitting code
patches.  Here is a list of these people, in alphabetical order.
Thank you to everyone.

Thanks are due also to FSF/France for providing access to their 
compile farm http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/CompileFarm
